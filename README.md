# Aficionado

Aficionado is an application that allows users to search and display over 200,000 art masterpieces from the Dutch national museum. Aficionado was developed by Daniel Ascher, Long Nguyen, Clay Crawley, and Lloyd Charles using the Rijksmuseum API. All art is from the Rijksmuseum Collection.

## Getting Started

To run this on your local device, you will need node.js and a MySQL database as well as a key from the [Rijksmuseum API](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/).  Alternatively, you can access a live version [here](https://homework014-project002.herokuapp.com/).

### Prerequisites

Once you have cloned the repo, run:
```
npm install or yarn install 
```
respectively.

You will also need to replace the placeholder information in the config/config.json file with your MySQL database info.  Finally, under routes/apiRoutes.js you will need to replace <Your Key> with your key to the [Rijksmuseum API](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/).
